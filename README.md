We (Pedro Almir and Evilasio Junior) decided to develop this tool to help Computer Science researchers on the visualization of conference location and deadlines. CAPES and Call For Papers website provide our data, and we do not conduct an exhaustive checking in this database. Even so, we believe that this tool can help you with your research schedule. Enjoy it!
